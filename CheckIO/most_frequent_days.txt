What is your favourite day of the week? Check if it's the most frequent day of the week in the year.
You are given a year as integer (e. g. 2001). You should return the most frequent day(s) of the week in that year. The
result has to be a list of days sorted by the order of days in week (e. g. ['Monday', 'Tuesday']). Week starts with
Monday.

Input: Year as an int.
Output: The list of most frequent days sorted by the order of days in week (from Monday to Sunday).
Preconditions: Year is between 1 and 9999. Week starts with Monday.


# okay, so only the first and last week of the year matter...
# even if you weird months like skip years, the day of the week really doesn't matter

# so I'll just check the first week of the year and the last week of the year...
# I just need to get [jan1 to Sun] + [Mon to Dec 31] into same list, and then do a simple
# count of each day...

# then I'll need a way to sort ties to sort by day of week... so maybe keep everything in a
# tuple, ('Monday',1),('Tuesday,2), etc. and sort by index...

# but how do you determine what the days look like for that year? like what the first week
# and last week even look like?
